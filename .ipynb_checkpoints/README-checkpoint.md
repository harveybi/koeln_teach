# course name

Welcome to the "course name"!
This repository will contain the lecture materials and scripts for the practical week.

Many of the concepts being covered thoughout the course are best learned and reinforced by implementing the ideas in code yourself.
If it's possible, please come with a laptop ready to code! We will also provide four laptops for the practical week.


## Before you arrive
#### Required
Please have Python 3+ (recommand 3.7/3.8) and request Python libraries installed.
We will be doing a lot of our development in IPython notebooks, so you'll likely want to have Jupyter installed as well, or have access to [Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/).
If you don't already have the aforementioned software installed, please go through the notebook labeled [0A_Python_Installation.ipynb](https://github.com/duke-mlss/Duke-NLP-WS-2020/blob/master/0A_PyTorch_Installation.ipynb). It'll guide you to install all required Python libraries.
Installing these should take about 5-10 minutes.

#### Optional
Given the pace of the course, we'll be assuming some background knowledge for scientific computing in Python.
If you are unfamiliar with IPython notebooks or Python coding environments, a brief introduction can be found in [0B_Coding_Environments.ipynb](https://github.com/duke-mlss/Duke-NLP-WS-2020/blob/master/0B_Coding_Environments.ipynb).


If you haven't used Python before, or want a refresher, we recommend [Python Like You Mean It](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/intro.html), by Ryan Soklaski. This free e-book consists of five short modules introducing Python for scientific computing and data analysis. Modules 1 and 2, on installing Python and Python essentials, will be especially useful. Module 3, which concerns the manipulation of matrices and vectors in Python, is very relevant but optional reading, as we will also be covering those topics in our sessions.
Alternatively, we provide a quick crash course in [0C_Python_Prerequisites.ipynb](https://github.com/duke-mlss/Duke-NLP-WS-2020/blob/master/0C_Python_Prerequisites.ipynb).


The easiest way to download these materials is to click the green "Clone or download" button near the top of this GitHub repo, and then Download ZIP.
However, we may update the materials in this GitHub repository as the course goes on.
If you're familiar with Git, the most seamless way to keep your files up-to-date is by cloning/forking this repository and pulling.
Alternatively, you can re-download this repo periodically, but you'll end up with duplicates.
